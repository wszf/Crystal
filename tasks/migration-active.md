# Crystal migration active index

Last verified: 2026-08-24 05:58 (Asia/Singapore)

This is the concise execution router for the persistent migration Goal. The Go
`docs/migration-matrix.md` remains the detailed status/evidence authority. Do not
copy its narratives here and do not read the full matrix during normal recovery.
Keep this file at or below 300 lines and 32 KiB.

## Progress semantics

- One main implementation leaf may be `Active`.
- A phase is scope-frozen only after its closure audit converts every vague
  residual into finite child leaves.
- Scope is frozen phase by phase; the whole project's remaining inventory does
  not need to be calculated in one up-front pass.
- `Complete` phase labels are not a project percentage. Leaf burn-down and ETA
  are publishable only for a scope-frozen phase.
- Current project-wide ETA and percentage remain `Unavailable`: P1 now has a
  finite denominator, but ten other phases still have open closure inventories.

## Phase routing summary

| Phase | Matrix status | Scope state | Closure leaf |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | Complete | Frozen | — |
| P1 | In progress | Frozen | `DISC-P1-CLOSURE` (Complete) |
| P2 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P2-CLOSURE` |
| P3 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P3-CLOSURE` |
| P4 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P4-CLOSURE` |
| P5 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P5-CLOSURE` |
| P6 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P6-CLOSURE` |
| P7 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P7-CLOSURE` |
| P8 | Complete | Frozen | — |
| P9 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P9-CLOSURE` |
| P10 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P10-CLOSURE` |
| P11 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P11-CLOSURE` |
| P12 | In progress | Open | `DISC-P12-CLOSURE` |

## Active batch

- Leaf ID: `NET-P1-HTTP-001`
- Status: `Active`; status monitoring is Complete at Go
  `269590b97f8f4f37d2387541a69981783fcc548b`.
- Outcome: restore optional trusted-IP HTTP startup/stop and exact root,
  account, name-list, broadcast, unknown-path, error, and POST behavior.
- Go matrix anchors to read: `### 2026-08-24 P1 finite closure inventory`, the
  `NET-P1-HTTP-001` row, and the row beginning `| P1 |` only.
- Legacy read authority: bounded `Server/Utils/HttpService.cs` and
  `Server/Utils/HttpServer.cs`, plus only direct `Envir` startup/stop and endpoint
  account/chat/name-list consumers.
- Go write authority: bounded HTTP setup/calls in `cmd/crystal-server/main.go`,
  plus new `http_service.go` and `http_service_test.go`.
- Forbidden scope: status/game gate redesign, broad process lifecycle, UI,
  unrelated persistence/protocol, logging/localization closure, and C#.

`CFG-P1-CONTRACT-001` is Complete in the verified Go candidate. Exact-case and
first-match INI behavior, UInt16 fallback/write-back, default production path,
CRYSTAL extension precedence, service mappings, version MD5 edge behavior, and
startup-visible failures are locked by focused/repeated/race tests. Its required
unexcluded integration run reproduced the established OmaMage flake; the
precisely excluded rerun and vet/build passed as recorded in the handoff.

`LOC-P1-CATALOG-001` is Complete at Go `d21681845090f0030e8f214628fd9aa3d60172b7`.
The complete 768-key defaults, exact 766-key English/Chinese assets, two active
English fallbacks, placeholders, unknown/malformed/rewrite/generation behavior,
startup loading, repeated tests, focused race, and integration attribution are
locked by Go-only production/test evidence.

`LOG-P1-CATEGORY-001` is Complete at Go
`0b7a68078e5bc4b182534ca5a5db7260b45267c7`. Production
startup/session wiring now covers all five Legacy categories, the exact rolling
layouts and three 100-entry queues, post-saturation file writes, Player/Spawn
file-only behavior, isolated sink failure/recovery, repeated tests, focused
race, fresh unexcluded integration, and full race.

`DISC-P1-CLOSURE` is Complete in committed control. A bounded
main-agent audit and independent read-only `luna_worker` review both found no
missing, duplicate, cross-phase, or non-observable P1 child. Static evidence
locks 768 default server keys, 981 direct lookups/765 used keys/three unused
aliases, 142 MessageQueue business invocations, and four direct Player/Spawn/
Server logger sites. P1 has five unfinished leaves and seven completed findings;
this is a P1 denominator only, not a project percentage.

### Protected Go ownership

- LOG code and matrix evidence are committed at Go `0b7a680`; no Go LOG path
  remains protected.
- NET gate code and evidence are committed at Go `46c1b81`; no gate file remains
  protected.
- NET status code and evidence are committed at Go `269590b`; no status path
  remains protected. Current HTTP-service ownership is recorded in the handoff.
- Later P1 leaves may share files only serially. The one active leaf owns the
  exact paths above; no subagent may expand them.

### Remaining acceptance work

- [ ] Lock exact enable flag, listener URI/prefix, trusted-IP comparison, startup
      failure, request dispatch, and StopNetwork closure semantics.
- [ ] Match `/`, `/newaccount`, `/addnamelist`, `/broadcast`, unknown path,
      malformed/query/error, and POST-visible response/side-effect behavior.
- [ ] Reuse existing account, chat, and NPC/name-list authorities without
      redesigning their owning P2-P4 features.
- [ ] Drive real HTTP production-entry tests, repeated/focused race, and the
      standard Leaf gate.

### P1 frozen child registry

Every functional leaf also runs the standard leaf gate. `Ready` means its finite
contract is registered; the dependency column determines whether it may be
selected now.

## Scope-freeze discovery queue

These are registered phase-local inventory audits, not permission to implement
broad unnamed scope.

| Leaf ID | Phase | Status | Required output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DISC-P1-CLOSURE` | P1 | Complete | 10 unfinished finite children + 2 completed audit items |
| `DISC-P2-CLOSURE` | P2 | Discovery | finite account/NPC-access/restart children |
| `DISC-P3-CLOSURE` | P3 | Discovery | finite startup/admin/ranking children |
| `DISC-P4-CLOSURE` | P4 | Discovery | finite map/bootstrap/visibility children |
| `DISC-P5-CLOSURE` | P5 | Discovery | finite spell/combat/AI/respawn/packet children |
| `DISC-P6-CLOSURE` | P6 | Discovery | finite item/equipment/craft children |
| `DISC-P7-CLOSURE` | P7 | Discovery | finite NPC/shop/quest/script children |
| `DISC-P9-CLOSURE` | P9 | Discovery | finite guild/war/territory children |
| `DISC-P10-CLOSURE` | P10 | Discovery | finite economy-system children |
| `DISC-P11-CLOSURE` | P11 | Discovery | finite miscellaneous-system children |
| `DISC-P12-CLOSURE` | P12 | Discovery | finite persistence/backup/deployment children |

## Selection protocol

1. Verify this index and the current handoff against each repository separately.
2. Resume only the one `Active` leaf; do not inventory all remaining phases up
   front.
3. When an active leaf completes, select one dependency-ready child from the
   current frozen phase before opening another phase discovery audit.
4. Keep only current routing state here. Completed details belong in the matrix
   and Git history, not as appended narratives.
