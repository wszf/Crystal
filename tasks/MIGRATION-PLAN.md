# Remaining Crystal → Go migration

Replanned 2026-09-07 from current C# and Go source; archived orchestration is
historical only. C# remains read-only. Implementation belongs in Crystal.GoServer.

## Current evidence

- Go has a working session dispatcher, account/character lifecycle, map loading,
  movement, inventory transactions, combat/spells, monster AI, pets/heroes,
  quests, shops/trade/mail/market, guilds/conquest, and periodic persistence.
  Evidence: `cmd/crystal-server/main.go`, the corresponding runtime files and
  session tests; `internal/auth`, `internal/protocol`, `internal/mapdata`,
  `internal/legacyworld`, and their tests. Presence is not proof of full parity.
- Import/export supports explicit legacy layouts (world/account 117/0 in
  legacyworld; legacyaccount also has a separate 116/0 catalog reader).
  All detected map formats 0–7 and 100 have implementations.
- Useful uncommitted WORLD work adds parser/runtime support for DROP, pets,
  MONGEN/MONCLEAR, buffs, guild membership and REFRESHEFFECTS. It includes
  protocol, persistence, recipient-order and production-session tests. Keep it.
  Constructor/refresh test changes account for the new spawn callers.
- Concrete gaps: Legacy `PlayerObject.CombineItem` and its connection dispatch
  have no Go packet/handler; Go's HornedWarriorShield constant is 56 while
  `Shared/Enums.cs` assigns 55 (56 is HornedCommanderShield).
- NPC player actions are substantially implemented, but C# NPCSegment also has
  actorless and monster action overloads. These require a separate execution-
  context audit; player-action coverage cannot establish their parity.
- A packet-name comparison is only a discovery aid: ReportIssue is an explicit
  Legacy no-op, and ClientVersion/LogOut/DellMember have differently named Go
  equivalents. Do not count these as missing gameplay from spelling alone.

## Next packages, in order

1. **Land WORLD NPC actions.** Review against NPCSegment, MapObject/HumanObject
   and DropInfo; retain useful pending files, exclude generated Envir/Goods
   data. Acceptance: parser/protocol tests, production NPC session tests,
   pet spawn/death timing, guild reload and DROP reward/capacity checks pass;
   run `go test ./...` before committing the implementation.
2. **Correct monster buff identity across player/monster projections.** Fix
   HornedWarriorShield's wire value and distinguish Commander. Check NPC enum
   lookup, AddBuff/removal and restored visibility against BuffInfo.Load.
   Acceptance: explicit numeric wire assertions and actor/observer lifecycle
   tests, affected monster tests and full Go suite pass.
3. **Implement CombineItem end to end.** Port packet layouts and Legacy
   admission checks, then item-type branches in focused commits using existing
   inventory authority. Acceptance: inventory and spawned-hero success/failure,
   dead/invalid/stale requests, RNG outcomes, packets, save/reload, and no item
   duplication. Read the whole C# method before selecting branch boundaries.
4. **Close NPC execution-context and data-path gaps.** Trace actorless/map and
   monster events from their C# callers into Go; implement missing reachable
   paths. Verify configured NPC/drop/insert roots through production startup
   (npcDropPath currently exists only in test/session construction). Acceptance:
   event-driven tests, parameter isolation, absent actor behavior and scripts
   loaded from a non-default data root; list any unsupported reachable actions.
5. **Rehearse migration and close discovered integration gaps.** With packages
   above in place, use a representative exported world/account dataset to
   exercise login → combat/quest → economy/guild → logout/restart. Compare packet
   traces and persisted balances/items/progress to Legacy. Audit remaining
   packet handlers, spell/AI dispatch and Settings consumers by behavior, then
   fix discrepancies in small commits. Acceptance: full tests, focused race
   checks, clean restart, and a recorded client smoke test with dataset/version.

## Remaining migration beyond individual features

Data compatibility and session/item authority precede new reward mutations;
shared buff/spawn behavior precedes NPC and monster consumers. After functional
parity, validate long-running timers, concurrent saves, crash/restart recovery,
operator configuration/logging, and realistic population/load before cutover.
Keep findings in this short plan; add the next concrete package as evidence
arrives, rather than declaring an exhaustive feature percentage.

## Non-goals and blockers

No C# implementation edits, global git configuration changes, new orchestration
framework, speculative server rewrite, or production cutover in these packages.
Retain existing tests even when their historical names mention old milestones.
No representative production dataset/client trace has been validated in this
review; production parity and load/cutover acceptance remain unproven until that
rehearsal. Unsupported legacy database versions must remain explicit errors.

## Execution

Plan committed before implementation. Test results and completed package commits
will be recorded here as work lands.
